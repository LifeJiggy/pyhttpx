## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow PEP 8 guidelines with some modifications:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Use type hints where possible

### Code Formatting

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting:

```bash
# Format code
black pyhttpx.py

# Check formatting
black --check pyhttpx.py
```

### Linting

Use [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting:

```bash
# Run linter
flake8 pyhttpx.py

# With specific rules
flake8 --max-line-length=88 --extend-ignore=E203,W503 pyhttpx.py
```

### Type Checking

We use [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for static type checking:

```bash
# Run type checker
mypy pyhttpx.py
```

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest test_pyhttpx.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=pyhttpx --cov-report=html

# Run tests in verbose mode
pytest -v
```

### Writing Tests

When adding new features, please include tests:

```python
import pytest
from pyhttpx import HTTPProber, ProbeResult

def test_new_feature():
    """Test description"""
    # Arrange
    args = create_test_args()
    prober = HTTPProber(args)

    # Act
    result = prober.probe_url("http://example.com")

    # Assert
    assert result.probe_status == True
    assert result.status_code == 200
```

### Test Coverage

Aim for high test coverage, especially for:
- Core probing functionality
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Different output formats
